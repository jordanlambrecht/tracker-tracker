# Changelog

## v1.1.0 — Chart & Detail Overhaul

### Features

- Chart legend system overhaul: scroll pagination replaced with natural wrapping, adjustable spacing, and an All/None toggle button on multi-series charts
- Log scale toggle added to 6 dashboard charts (Buffer, Seedbonus, Active Torrents, Total Uploaded, Ratio Stability, Buffer Velocity) with auto-detect when data spans >100x range
- Tracker detail page redesign: TrackerHub status card with animated collapse, user ranks table with perk pills, release/notable/banned group badges, elder torrents table with rank column and marquee ticker
- Torrents tab: compact table mode, category acquisition chart, 3D torrent age scatter plot, dead torrents card, average seed time stat card and cohort chart, full-width unsatisfied progress bars
- Ratio chart: red dashed baseline at minimum required ratio
- StatCard tooltip support with hover popup
- Sidebar: archived tracker styling (dimmed, static dot, "Archived" label) and GitHub repo link
- New logo

### Refactoring

- Tracker detail page slimmed from 1,229 to 265 lines — extracted TrackerDetailHeader, UserProfileCard, AnalyticsTab, TrackerInfoTab, CoreStatCards, PollLog, platform-specific guard components, and independent data-fetching hooks with AbortControllers
- Dashboard page split into AnalyticsSection and EcosystemStatsSection components
- Chart preference hooks consolidated into shared `useChartPreferencesBase`
- StatCard value/unit prop split for consistent formatting

### Fixes

- Log(0) crash in ComparisonChart when switching to log scale with zero-value data points
- VolumeSurface3D (Upload Landscape) background now matches card surface instead of broken WebGL transparent
- Tracker GET endpoint hardened with column projection (excludes avatarData, encrypted tokens from response)
- computeDelta BigInt null guard prevents crash on missing snapshot data
- StrictMode abort race condition: loading state only clears when the active request completes
- Emoji picker overflow in tag group settings
- Proxy toggle disabled when no proxy is configured
- Join date input capped to today in both UI and API validation
- Redirect to dashboard after archiving a tracker
- Design system alignment: raw `<p>` elements replaced with `<H2>` component across dashboard sections
